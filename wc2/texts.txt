Echoes of Hello

In the morning light, a bird sings hello,
A gentle breeze whispers, soft and mellow.
The flowers bloom with colors that glow,
In every petal, a sweet hello.

Across the hills where rivers flow,
Mountains greet with echoes of hello.
The sun arises, casting a golden halo,
Embracing the world with its warm hello.

In bustling streets where people go,
Strangers smile and exchange hellos.
In every language, high and low,
A universal greeting, hello.

In twilight’s glow, as stars bestow,
Night’s embrace with a silent hello.
In dreams where fantasies overflow,
A million voices softly say hello.

From dawn to dusk, in joy or sorrow,
Life is a series of endless hellos.
A word so simple, yet it shows,
The bond we share in every hello.
